# Project-4-Hostel-Hack

## Overview
Through the Hostel Hack application, users have the ability to keep track of their favorite hostels/trips, which will include upcoming events. This application has full CRUD on the hostels, allowing users to add new trips, update their trips (change dates, etc.), and delete hostels/trips. They will also have the ability to add upcoming events and delete events if they are no longer interested.
